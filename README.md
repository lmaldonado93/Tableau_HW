 Citibike_Ridership

Peak hours of riding in either winter months and summer months, seems to be from 5am to 9am and 4pm and 7pm. This could be because of individual who chooses to bike from home to work and work to home. Instead of taking public transportation.

Majority of the riders are male biker who could be born between 1970 and 1975.

Best starting and ending location is at Pershing Square North which is located on 42nd st and Park Ave Manhattan, NY. Being near to Grand Central Terminal a Major Hub of public transportation. Makes it easy for both worker and tourist to start and end journey.

Within the year 2018 ridership growth increase on both customer and subscriber from January to December. Where Customer who are non-subscriber increased 176.4%. 

BikeID 30503 seemed to have had a long journey. Being the bike that has ridden the most with a tripduration of 19,593,272 compare to second place who has a tripduration of 16,141,482 thats a difference of 3,451,790. Its like they both needs to be retired or at least requieres maintance more often.
